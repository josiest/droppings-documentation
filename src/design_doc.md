# Droppings Design

## Basic Game Flow

### Arcade Mode

- Divine fruit is randomly placed on board
- Player moves to eat the divine fruit
- When divine fruit is eaten
  - gains acension point
  - timer starts to "lay a dropping"
- Player must avoid the droppings they lay
- When acension points are filled, board event happens
- Game ends when player eats dropping, or ascension goal is reached

### Story/Puzzle Mode

- TBD

## Board Events

### Possibilities for first iteration
- Clears entire board
- Clears a certain amount of random droppings
- Clears random rows and columns - with visual element to communicate to player

### Possibilitise for second iteration
- Player can choose between three cards which change things up
  - similar to Nuclear throne
